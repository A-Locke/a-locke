Meeting Notes - Acme Widgets Pricing Strategy

Date: April 18, 2025
Attendees: John Doe (CEO), Jane Smith (CFO), Alice Johnson (VP Sales), Bob Brown (Marketing Director)

1. Overview
The quarterly pricing review was conducted to align the new product pricing strategy with market conditions. Revenue for Q1 was up 8%, driven primarily by the premium segment.

2. Proposed Price Adjustments
- Standard Widget: Increase from $49 to $54
- Premium Widget: Increase from $89 to $99
- Widget Subscription Plan: Maintain at $15/month but introduce a 10% discount for annual prepayment.

3. Competitive Analysis
- WidgetCo recently raised prices by 12%.
- Gearify maintained prices but launched a basic model with fewer features.
- BetaTools lowered prices by 5% but is losing market share.

4. Customer Feedback
Surveys indicate that 75% of customers would tolerate a 5-10% price increase if accompanied by feature enhancements or loyalty rewards. There is a risk of losing 10% of price-sensitive customers.

5. Marketing Campaign
Bob Brown presented the upcoming "More Value Than Ever" campaign, emphasizing added features and long-term savings.

6. Action Items
- Update website pricing pages by May 1.
- Notify existing customers two weeks in advance.
- Train the sales team to handle price increase objections.

7. Next Meeting
Scheduled for July 15, 2025, to assess the impact of the changes.
