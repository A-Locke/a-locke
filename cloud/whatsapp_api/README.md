   `https://graph.facebook.com/v19.0/<PHONE_NUMBER_ID>/messages`
3. **Headers**:
   ```json
   {
     "Authorization": "Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>",
     "Content-Type": "application/json"
   }
   ```
4. **Body (JSON)**:
   ```json
   {
     "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
     "to": "<recipient_phone_number>",
     "type": "text",
     "text": { "body": "Hello from n8n!" }
   }
   ```

### Optional:
- Add error-handling nodes, delay logic, or conditional flows.
