## 🧭 Objective

This repository documents my **hands-on learning journey** in **Cybersecurity**, **Cloud Computing**, and **Artificial Intelligence**. Each project is a step toward mastering key skills and preparing for industry-recognized certifications.  
Here, I apply theory to real-world scenarios, reflect on lessons learned, and build a portfolio that showcases my technical capabilities.
